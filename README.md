# 🎓 CGPA Calculator (C++)

A simple console-based CGPA Calculator built in C++ that allows students to input their course grades and credit hours, computes their Semester GPA, and calculates the Overall CGPA efficiently. This project is ideal for beginners learning basic C++ concepts like arrays, loops, functions, and file handling.

# ✨ Features

~ Input the number of courses taken.

~ Enter grades and credit hours for each course.

~ Compute Semester GPA (Grade Points Average).
